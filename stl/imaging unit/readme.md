My imaging unit modifications are minor
1: my rotor design has a flat top to keep the imaging unit aimed at the centerpoint 
of the rotor.

2: I designed the imaging unit to use COB LED rings. The version I purchased and have 
test fit are https://www.amazon.com/dp/B078SR4JRS The plastic diffusers that came with
the rings is not used. Note I have test fit the assembly but not actually used it, so
I do not know if the diffusors need to be used.
