These platform designs are untested

Post table is a top for something that will be vertical while scanning, like a key, 
the hole in the top is sized for 3mm rod to be able to superglue the object to be 
scanned to the rod and not damage the top with the April tag scale

The April tags are all unique across all the platforms. The wells are 1mm deep which
works great for filling in with white UV resin when the platforms are printed with
black resin. Note: I have not yet attempted to process any scans taken with these
platforms so I do not know if the April tags need tweaking
